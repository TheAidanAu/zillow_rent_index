#### Sources (csv)

unemployment_csv
multifam.csv
nonfarm.csv
FLSTHPI.csv
acs

so the multifam.csv was probably one of the files attached from Kyle's original email and renamed.

The acs file seems to have been generated by Aidan in 02_DataFrame_Merging notebook as acs_concat, but that's not completely clear where it gets written to disk.  This df was made by concatenating a bunch of acs_(year) dfs, which in turn were downloaded from BigQuery, specifically the census_bureau_acs database and tables zip_codes_(year)_5yr (confirmed by Aidan Dec 14)


For the other files, it's not clear where they came from.

Update Dec 14: the FLSTHPI is taken directly from the stlouis fed website at the following link:

#### Pipeline

From these files, Jacob created the total_df in the notebook "Rent Idx Initial EDA" and wrote the file total_df.csv

From here, John created ols models in one_model_per_year and First_cut_pred_model, though the latter used the data for all years to fit one ols, which at the moment does not seem to be the right choice, so that notebook is probably a dead end.

We also anticipate that Jacob and/or Jordan will have our first cut of a random forest shortly.
